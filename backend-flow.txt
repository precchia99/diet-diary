|| SQLITE ||
- add sqlite extension
- open database, expand database botton left, run user

|| FASTAPI ||
- open terminal, 'cd BackEnd'- EVERYTIME
- download python
- 'python -m venv ./venv-diet-diary'- EVERYTIME
-- creates venv-diet-diary folder (doesn't really matter)

- '.\venv-diet-diary\Scripts\activate'  - EVERYTIME
-- should see green words to the left

- 'pip install fastapi'
- 'pip install "uvicorn[standard]"'
- 'pip install sqlmodel'
- 'pip install pydantic[email]'
- 'uvicorn main:app --reload' - EVERYTIME

BACKEND READY!

|| TEST IT ||
- open index.html
- log in
- use the email in the database sqlite (john smith) - should log in
- incorrect email won't work, in console it'll be null
- try sign up
- adding new account should log it into the sqlite database
- using an existing email won't work

|| What We NEED ||
- Meals table on database.py file

|| WORKFLOW ||
- .html file connected to script.js file
- script.js file has 'users' in url that is connected to main.py file (that file uses fastapi which is a python library that creates api)
- main.py fastapi python code is able to go to sqlite database and pull the information that we need
- it is able to do this by using the database.py file (uses sqlmodel which is a python libary that can connect & create database/tables - run top right)
